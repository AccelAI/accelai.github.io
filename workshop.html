											<a href="#modal10" class="image"><img src="images/sujit.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Sujit Pal - Elsevier</h3>
											<h4>DCNNs in Keras</h4>
											<p>This talk will describe how a Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) trained on the ImageNet dataset can be used to classify images in a completely different domain. The intuition that the training process teaches the DCNN to extract good features from images is explored with visualizations. Transfer Learning freezes the bottom layers of the DCNN to extract image vectors from a training set in a different domain, which can then be used to train a new classifier for this domain. Fine tuning involves training the pre-trained network further for the target domain. Both approaches are demonstrated using a VGG-16 network pre-trained on ImageNet to classify medical images into 5 categories. Code examples are provided using Keras.</p>

									<h2>Carlos' Bio</h2>
									<p>Carlos' most recent endeavors are using Deep Learning (A.I.) in two of his startups (Biofabs, LUSH Robotics) - coupling algorithms and massively parallel computing to mimic the very neural networks that govern the behavior of what our brains do best - pattern recognition.  Carlos is a serial entrepreneur, leading and advising startups as founder/ developer/ product manager/ instructor.  His passion is one of leveraging converging disciplines, and harnessing the power of distributed innovation & digital fabrication - and putting them to work in robotics.  Most recently he was the Director of the Innovation Lab ( iLab) at Singularity University (SU) where he served the mission to educate and empower present and future leaders towards leveraging exponential technologies.</p>
									<p>Carlos has always prescribed to the SU mindset, in that everyone should inspire to ‘think big’ as an entrepreneur, especially when subscribing to make things that will help a billion people within 10 years. Carlos holds a Masters in Bioengineering from UCSD and the equivalent of a Masters in Computer Vision, and Robotics from INPG/ INRIA in Grenoble, France.</p>
